# rbackup

**Automated Rsync-based System Backup Utility**

This script creates a full backup of the root filesystem to another device partition labeled `rootfs` (except the current root).  
It checks for sufficient space, supports both interactive and batch/cron modes, and enforces manual approval of backup options for safety.  
It uses `rsync` with safe options and logs all operations.  
Ideal for SD card or disk cloning on Linux systems.

**Note:**  
You do **not** need to run this script with `sudo`â€”if not started as root, it will re-invoke itself using `sudo` automatically.


## Note
By default, rback will not produce any output in batch mode, and not much if run interactively.
So, if you want information, what files are or would have been be processed, you should have a look at rsync-options (`man rsync`). You can add these at the end of the  rbackup command introduced by  `--`. All options after that are passed on to rsync. So to get detailed file-proccessing information you could use `-- -i'.

## Options

- `--dry-run`  
  Perform a trial run. Exits silently on success. To see what files are processed use `--dry-run -- -i' and look at the note above.


- `-h`, `--help`  
  Show help text.

- `--`  
  All following options are passed directly to `rsync`.

## Usage

### Interactive Backup (run)

```sh
./rbackup --dry-run
# or
./rbackup
```
You will be prompted with source and target device information, and asked to choose:
- `r` to run and approve this command for cron use.
- `a` to approve for cron but NOT run now.
- `q` to quit.

### Cron/Batch Backup (approve + cron)

First, approve desired options interactively:
```sh
./rbackup --dry-run   # choose 'a' to approve for cron only
```
Then, schedule via cron. The script will only run with previously approved options:
```sh
# In crontab:
0 2 * * * /path/to/rbackup --dry-run
```
If no approval file exists for the chosen options, the cron run will be blocked and logged.

## Notes

- The script requires root privileges, but will automatically use `sudo` if you do not have them.
- All operations are logged in `/var/log/rbackup.log`.
- Approval mechanism prevents accidental or malicious use in cron jobs.

## Example

Interactive run:
```sh
./rbackup --dry-run

Source: /dev/mmcblk0p2 (SD/MMC, ModelX, VendorY, PARTUUID=xxxx)
Target: /dev/sda1 (USB, ModelZ, VendorQ, PARTUUID=yyyy)
Your choice (run/approve/quit) [r/a/q]:
```

Cron run (after prior approval):
```sh
./rbackup --dry-run
# (No prompt; runs automatically if previously approved.)
```
