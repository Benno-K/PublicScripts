#Abstract:
# This script fetches the comic-strip of a
# certain kind from gocomics.com for a
# certain date.
# The default kind is nonsequitur.
# The default date is today.
# It replaces the nonsequitur-script which
# ceased to work with the latest 
# restructuring in 2025 of the GoComics 
# CMS-generated website
