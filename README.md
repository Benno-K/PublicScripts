# PublicScripts

## myip
Simple script using curl and ipify.org
to determine own external IP address
If you are connected to the Internet
using a FRITZ!box I would recommend the extip script over this script as 
it does not depend on remote servers

## extip
Script to determine the exzernal IP
address of your FRITZ!box, which is your hosts IP as well in most cases
