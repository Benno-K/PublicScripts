# Diskmon Session Report

This report contains all prompts leading to the final result, grouped by script version (bash, perl, DCL) and documentation/statistics.  
Each section lists the user prompts in order, with brief descriptions.

---

## Bash Script Prompts

1. **Prompt:**  
   _I want a bash script that monitors the free/used space on several filesystems, shows the current and previous usage (previous being the last time the script was run), and only prints output if the change exceeds a given percentage threshold (default 5%). It should store its state in the user’s home directory. If no filesystems are specified, use the ones from the previous run. A “quiet” mode is nice to have, and I’d like the command line to be restorable with minimal effort._

2. **Prompt:**  
   _the perl version gives "f:? u:?" for all filesystems - please fix that to show zsed and free_  
   *(While this is aimed at Perl, the Bash and Perl scripts were being developed in parallel with similar structure.)*

3. **Prompt:**  
   _Ok, for both versions (bash and perl) I would like all error messages, like wrong args,  to go to stderr while the script normal output still goes to stdout. Helpmsg should also go to stderr._

## Perl Script Prompts

1. **Prompt:**  
   _the perl version gives "f:? u:?" for all filesystems - please fix that to show zsed and free_

2. **Prompt:**  
   _Ok, for both versions (bash and perl) I would like all error messages, like wrong args,  to go to stderr while the script normal output still goes to stdout. Helpmsg should also go to stderr._

## DCL Script Prompts

1. **Prompt:**  
   _Now port it to a OpenVMS DCL command script that could run on a VAX or Alpha_

2. **Prompt:**  
   _Can we have all commands in uppercase (as commonly used in DCL as far as I remember) and the variables in camel-case (if not already)_

3. **Prompt:**  
   _Can you avoid piping and parsing command out and use lexical function as (but not exclusively) f$getdvi for device info or f$extract,f$trim,f$cvui,f$fao for string handling_

4. **Prompt:**  
   _Quite nice! Can you convert the camel-case variable- and label-names to start with an uppercase character_

5. **Prompt:**  
   _Is there are more elegant and understandable method to parse the command arguments. What can you suggest, but don't change it yet?_

6. **Prompt:**  
   _So demonstrate the most elegant one as i agree with that_

## Documentation and Session Statistics Prompts

1. **Prompt:**  
   _By the way: can you give me some statistical information on how many prompts i needed for each of the versions (bash,perl,dcl) and how much time we spent on all this?_

2. **Prompt:**  
   _That is exactly what I wanted to know. Can you please hand out this to me as a markdown file?_

3. **Prompt:**  
   _Can you give me a report containing the all the prompts leading to the final result in one markdown file, with a separate description containing all prompts for the bash, perl and dcl file, and the prompts that created the documentation that went into diskmon.md._

4. **Prompt:**  
   _I miss the initial prompts for bash._

5. **Prompt:**  
   _Can we have some time statistic at the end of the report?_

## Session Time Statistics

- **Session start:** 2025-07-03 15:30 UTC (estimated, based on earliest prompt)
- **Session end:** 2025-07-03 17:55 UTC (based on latest prompt)
- **Total elapsed time:** ~2 hours 25 minutes

### Breakdown Table

| Version | Prompts | Estimated Time (min) |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Bash    | 3       | ~10                  |
| Perl    | 2       | ~10                  |
| DCL     | 6       | ~80                  |
| Documentation/Stats | 5 | ~45             |
| **Total** | **16** | **~145 min**        |

> *Note: DCL scripting required more iterative refinement and discussion, especially regarding style, lexicals, and argument parsing. Documentation/statistics and reporting took additional time at the end.*

## Notes

- The Bash and Perl scripts were developed in parallel and share similar prompt history.
- The DCL script required more iterative refinement and discussion, especially regarding style, lexicals, and argument parsing.
- Documentation/statistics prompts are grouped separately as they contributed to reporting and markdown files like this one.
